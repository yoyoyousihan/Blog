## The Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is defined as follows:

$$
f(x;\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }
$$

To generate random draws from a normal distribution we use the **rnorm** function:

```{r block1}
output <- rnorm(1000, 100, 15);
```

The normal distribution has the typical bell shape:


You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
